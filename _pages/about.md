I am a PhD student at MIT’s Operations Research Center, where I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [Chara Podimata](https://www.charapodimata.com/). Previously, I completed my diploma in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Dimitris Fotakis.
