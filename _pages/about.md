I am a Phd Student at MIT ORC extremely fortunate to be advised by [Chara Podimata](https://www.charapodimata.com/). Prior to that, I earned my "diploma" from the EECS department at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) where I had the luck to be mentored by Professor [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/180).
