I am a PhD student at MIT’s Operations Research Center, where I feel extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [Chara Podimata](https://www.charapodimata.com/). Previously, I completed my diploma in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Dimitris Fotakis. 

Research wise I am interested in the interplay between machine learning algorithms and humans. In particular, I am interested into exploring how algorithmic performance and fairness shift when data come from individuals actively adapting—strategically, socially, or cognitively—to the algorithm’s outputs.
